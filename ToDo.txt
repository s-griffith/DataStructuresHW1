General Data Structure:
1. AVL Tree of movies by ID
2. AVL Tree of users by ID (AllUsers)
3. AVL Tree of groups by ID: each node represents a group, each group holds an AVL tree of users by ID
    - pointer between AllUsers and its group's node - update group sum totals in O(1) as needed
    - user in group node is a pointer of the actual user node held in AllUsers
    - counter of # users in each group held by group node
    - bool value of VIP held by group node - true if at least one user in group is VIP
    - update values held by group node during insertion to group using logm complexity
4. 4 AVL rank Trees, one per genre, organized by: rate, views, ID
    - pointer between node in large tree and node in genre tree
    - each node points to the "max" node in its subtree
5. Counter of # movies in system total
6. AVL rank tree of all movies according to: rate, views, ID

***Might be easier to just add a field in MultiTree that points to max term always (rather than make rank tree)

Done!Notes:
-Genre is const
-Inside user class - each user has a groupPointer --> if null, you know it isn't in any group
-Inside user class - hold an array of length 5 (one per genre + NONE) that counts number of views of movies of each genre
-Inside movie class - rating field (int)
-Inside group class - array of genres, where each cell is total number of watches for that genre

Classes: Should we make a parent class that contains only ID and VIP?
Done!1. User:
    - groupID: pointer to group that belongs to
    - ID
    - views array
    - VIP
    -
Done!2. Movie:
    - rating
    - views
    - genre
    - ID
    - VIP
    - number of people who rated the movie (int)
Done!3. Group:
    - AVL tree of pointers of type user
    - array of genres, where each cell is total number of views for that genre (totalViews)
    - ID
    - VIP
    - totalUsers
    - array of genres, to add 1 for each user when the group watches a movie (subtract) (GroupViews)

Functions:
- streaming_database: *Shlomo
    - initialize 7 empty AVL trees, according to the list above
    - counter of # movies in total system = 0
    - etc.
- virtual ~streaming_database(): *Sarah
    - delete
- add_movie: *Shlomo
    - insert to allMovies AVL tree
    - insert to allMovies MultiAVL Tree
    - insert to relevant genre tree (unless genre=NULL)
    - define fields as given
- remove_move: *Sarah
    - delete from AVL tree of allMovies
    - delete from allMovies MultiAVL tree
    - delete from genre tree if relevant
- add_user: *Shlomo
    - insert to AllUsers Tree
    - initialize fields
- remove_user: *Sarah
    - remove from AllUsers tree
    - remove from group tree if in a group
- add_group: *Shlomo
    - add group to AVL tree of all groups
    - initialize fields
- remove_group: *Sarah
    - go over tree of users inside group, set each user's groupID = nullptr
    - remove group from AVL tree
- add_user_to_group: *Shlomo
    - search for user in AllUsers Tree
    - search for group in group Tree
    - add user to group tree's user tree
    - update user's groupID pointer
    - add the user's views from each genre to the total views array (totalViews)
    - subtract the user's views from total views for each genre in the group's node (GroupViews array)
- user_watch: *Sarah
    - find user and movie
    - check if user is VIP and if movie is VIP
    - increase views on movie by 1
    - insert and delete from allMovies MultiAVL tree
    - ++ to views in that genre for user
    - ++ to views in that genre for user's group (if exists) in totalViews
- group_watch: *Sarah
    - find group in tree
    - find movie
    - check VIP thing
    - ++ to views in that genre in GroupViews
    - ++*(# users) to views in that genre in totalViews
    _ ++*(#users) to views on that movie
    - insert and delete from allMovies MultiAVL tree
- get_all_movies_count: *Shlomo
    - go to the AVL rank tree of relevant genre and return number of children held by the root
    - if genre=NONE, return counter of number of movies in system
- get_all_movies: *Sarah
    - if None: return *opposite* inorder walk on allMovies MultiAVL tree
    - otherwise: return *opposite* inorder walk on movie MultiAVL tree by genre
- get_num_views: *Shlomo
    - return number of views + group's GroupViews for that user
- rate_movie: *Shlomo
    - ++ to number of people who rated the movie
    - += to the rating
    - insert and remove from MultiAVL allMovies tree
    - insert and remove from MultiAVL movies tree according to genre (if not NONE)
- get_group_recommendation: ***
    - determine favorite genre by finding max in totalViews array of that group
    - choose the "max" movie in the correct genre (according to the pointer in the root of that genre's MultiAVL tree)
